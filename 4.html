    <h1>JavaScript</h1>
  JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/[6]), often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based, multi-paradigm, and interpreted programming language.
  <br>Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.
  <br>It is used to make webpages interactive and provide online programs, including video games. The majority of websites employ it,
  <br>and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine. Each of the many JavaScript engines represent
  <br>a different implementation of JavaScript, all based on the ECMAScript specification, with some engines not supporting the spec fully, and with many engines supporting additional features beyond ECMA.
