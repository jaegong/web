  The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space
  <br>where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs),
  <br>interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet.[1] English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
  <br>He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland.[2][3] The Web browser was released outside of CERN in 1991, first to other
  <br>esearch institutions starting in January 1991 and to the general public on the Internet in August 1991.
